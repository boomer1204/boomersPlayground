                    <p>I decided to start the journey into web development so I could get a good paying job and hopefully work remotely so I can travel and enjoy the world.  After looking into a couple of bootcamps and different courses I decided on 2 courses.  I have some very light html/css knowledge so I was hoping for something with some backend language that they focus on.  I found 2 (and mind you I am not affiliated nor do I make any money for anyone joining them) but the two I found are https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course/#/ which focuses on html/css/js/jquery/php so the ‘standard’ web languages.  The second one I found was https://codermanual.com/ which focuses on Ruby on Rails.</p>

                    <p>The first course I found was the udemy course and it was on sale.  I went through the first couple of sections and brushed up on my html/css and then on to the javascript and jquery.  The instructor Rob does a good job of showing you how to use the language and does a decent job of explaining why the things are working.  I went through these and then got an email from stacksocial about another deal.</p>

                    <p>The second course I found was codermanual.com and that course is based off of Ruby on Rails.  If you have been on the internet at all and interested in web development you have run across Ruby on Rails.  It’s the hot new startup language capable of building applications quickly compared to other languages and scaling quickly as well.  This course is well thought out and uses codeacademy’s courses to learn the fundamentals and then goes into a deeper dive into the methodology behind it.  I thought the course was good and I finished all the way until Phase 2 were you are given links to other sites to learn other common languages.  The only thing that I didn’t care for is most of the course when you are creating your SaaS project there are a lot of times that the instructor also Rob says “I don’t expect you to understand what this means”.  It was to the point that I almost concerned stoping the course as I was just following his instruction with no reasoning behind it.  I’m thankful I stuck with it because the last section of videos ties everything together and you finally understand what’s happening.  If you decide to go with this course stick it out and it will all bind together.</p>

                    <p>I’m going to go back and do the rest of the udemy course to round out some my backend knowledge and then go through some stuk.io courses to really embed the Ruby on Rails stuff.

                    <p>Keep checking back as I go through these courses and build my projects.</p>

                    <p>Thanks!!!</p>
