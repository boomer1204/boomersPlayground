                    <p>Hey guys it’s Boomer again.  This is my second post and it’s going to help you learn how to learn and how to ask questions.</p>

                    <p>I feel weird writing this post because i’m FAR from the most knowledgeable guy on any topic (except bullshitting) and yet I still feel the need to explain to people how to learn and ask questions..</p>

                    <p>Now I have been “coding” for about a year (in reality I have been learning minuscule inconsequential useless lines of code that I could barely put a website together with.  Now the first lesson of this post is going to be how to learn.  For the past year I have been bouncing from one shiny object language to the next and never learning anything.  Unfortunately that is not a marketable skill knowing 10% of 10 languages.  You want to become proficient with 1 language and then have small competencies in a bunch of other ones, this shows you can master one but are capable of learning others.  Now I never thought of it like this and like many new comers to the web dev world this happens a lot.  With that being said the first lesson is pick a language, ANY LANGUAGE and STICK WITH IT!!!!  It’s really that simple, there is no ‘best language’ as long as it’s a semi relevant language it’s fine to learn because their will be jobs for it.  This is probably the number one thing I see and almost fell victim to myself is jumping from language to language but I move on.</p>

                    <p>Now the next thing I have noticed since I took my pick a language and learn is people don’t know how to find the answers or even ask for the questions.  Let’s start with a simple question and you can answer in your head (and be honest don’t try and cheat the system).  When you have a problem what is your first response??  I though it was to google it but after being a part of a couple of different online courses (multiple different languages so this doesn’t change when you are learning different languages) that is not the case.  We as a generation have this HUGE entitlement that we “deserve” the answers immediately because of the tech giants reporting it to us as quick as we can search it.  Now there are a couple issues with that ….  The first being are we sure that’s the correct answer (and in most cases it is but really we are just trusting the really smart guys at google to decide that for us) and secondly are you really learning anything by this method??  I understand it can be frustrating to have to ‘take the time’ to find the answer but you will gain so much from finding the answer yourself instead of seeking the direct answer from a forum.  I have a couple of friends in the development world and they after years say they still google stuff all the time and it’s a skill set to find the answers.</p>

                    <p>Now I understand there are some instances when you either can’t put the information together to form the answer or you can’t find it and THAT’S FINE as long as you tried.  Now the following part is how to ask a question among st your learning peers.  When you have a a problem with code there is a lot going on depending on your level of knowledge.  Just getting on the chat and saying “Hey my code doesn’t work why not”??   Now I understand you know what you are talking about but the knowledgeable people on the forum/chat/question board aren’t mind readers and that kind of question shows you don’t respect or honor their time and you are far less likely to get help.</p>

                    <p>The more specific you can be the better of an answer.  To try and compare it to something let’s look at it like this, if I come up to you and say ‘My sandwich doesn’t taste right’.  What do you do with that??  What kind of sandwich, is it supposed to be cooked, missing toppings, meat, wrong bread??  I think you get my point.  Instead if I ask ‘Why doesn’t my ham and cheese sandwich taste right??’.  We now know the things that are supposed to be in that sandwich and can start pinpointing it.  I realize that’s a pretty bad analogy but i’m just trying to prove a point.  Let the community know what you did between when your code worked and didn’t (did you add a new class, scaffold, migrate the db), give what you expected to happen, then give what actually happened and this is the MOST IMPORTANT ……….. share your code via jsbin, codepen, screenshot or the code features in almost every discussion forum, chat and messenger.</p>

                    <p>Again sorry to rant because I know i’m not the best and have made the same mistakes but I feel like if you truly wanna be a developer and get better these are a couple things that can not only help you learn better but help you stand out among st the rest of the ‘wanna be developers’ out there.  Plus when you start to finish courses and understand a language one of the best ways to help reinforce it is to help ‘teach’ other people so you will be on the other end so just instill the proper habits and it will be a good time for everyone!!!  If you guys have any questions, comments or just wanna chat you can find me on the regular social media guys at the top or you can gchat me boomer1204 and i’d be happy to talk.  Everyone take care and hope to see you guys soon!!!</p>
